#### Deployment Guide on Docker
    -> install maven
    -> clone source code from git
    -> navigate to the source code's root directory/folder
    -> run on terminal 'mvn clean package'
    -> install docker
    -> run on terminal 'docker-compose up -d' to build and run as container on docker
    ## BUT I WILL ADVISE TO RUN THE TEST CLASSES WITHOUT DOCKER

### TO TEST APP
    -> ensure that maven is installed
    -> clone source code from git
    -> navigate to the source code's root directory/folder
    -> run on terminal 'mvn clean test'
